# School District Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
In this project we looked at numerious pieces of data for an entire school district for budgeting purposes. This analysis was also conducted twice. The first analysis was with all the student's data. The second was without Thomas High School's 9th grade class math and reading scores. This is because there is potential academic dishonesty, specifically within the Thomas High School's 9th grade class.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?

The school district summary was not heavily affected by removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School. The averages remained the same and the percentages changed less than .5%.
